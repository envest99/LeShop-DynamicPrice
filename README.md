# Dynamic Pricing
In the Swiss online supermarket, the main initiatives are currently product range/ availability, same-day delivery and dynamic prices at the lowest possible cost. The latter is hereby demonstrated with a study using the example of the product assortment/price strategy of the Migros subsidiary LeShop. The underlying company and process data are based on plausible public information and detailed invoices. LeShop currently uses a simple, same pricing strategy with a traditional data flow model. This study examines the profit potential with a suitable pricing strategy and an adapted data flow model. The approximated data used for this purpose is stored under the data model functions Classification of Pricing Strategy.
